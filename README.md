# 🧠 Mathematics for Machine Learning & Research Log

**Documentation of Independent Study & Technical Notes**

This repository serves as the central documentation for my transition from Telecommunication Engineering to **Applied Machine Learning Research**. It contains structured notes, mathematical derivations, Python implementations, and reserch logs.

The curriculum follows a rigorous path from mathematical foundations to advanced deep learning architectures, designed to prepare for a **Master’s degree in AI (with a strong interest in Japan)**.
