# 🧠 ML Path to Mastery: Research & Learning Log

> **"I don't become new by promising loud. I become new by choosing better now."**

Welcome to my digital garden. This repository documents my journey from **Telecommunication Engineering** to becoming an **Applied Machine Learning Researcher**.

Here, I store my raw notes, mathematical derivations, code snippets, and daily progress logs.

## 🗺️ The Roadmap

### 1️⃣ Phase 1: Mathematical Foundations (Nov - Dec 2025)
*Goal: Build rigorous intuition before coding.*

- [x] **Linear Algebra** (Vectors, Matrices, Eigenvalues) - *Source: 3Blue1Brown*
- [x] **Calculus** (Derivatives, Integrals, Taylor Series) - *Source: 3Blue1Brown*
- [ ] **Mathematics for ML** (Implementation in Python) - *Source: Imperial College London (Coursera)*
- [ ] **Probability & Statistics** - *Source: Khan Academy*

### 2️⃣ Phase 2: Classical Machine Learning (Jan - Feb 2026)
*Goal: Master the "Scikit-Learn" era algorithms.*

- [ ] Supervised Learning (Regression, SVM, Decision Trees)
- [ ] Unsupervised Learning (K-Means, PCA)
- [ ] Model Evaluation & Validation

### 3️⃣ Phase 3: Deep Learning & Research (Mar 2026 - Onwards)
*Goal: Modern AI & Preparation for S2 Japan.*

- [ ] Neural Networks & Backpropagation
- [ ] Computer Vision (CNNs)
- [ ] Time Series Forecasting (RNN/LSTM/Transformers)
- [ ] **Research Project:** IoT Water Quality Prediction (Flocify)
